            <h1>About Nicholas</h1>

            <img class="portrait" src="images2/NickChampionshipRingj.jpg" alt="Portrait of Nicholas Zayas">

            <p>Nicholas Zayas, at only 9 years of age, is not just a baseball player, he is a young sports enthusiast with dreams bigger than the field. 
                Born on July 15th, 2015, Nicholas has been swinging the bat almost as long as he's been walking. 
                Living in a family where sportsmanship and teamwork are core values, he has always found the baseball diamond to be his second home. 
                Nicholas plays shortstop, and pitches for his travel team, The Wolfpack, showcasing not only his skill but also his leadership on the field. 
                His dedication to baseball goes beyond just playing. He spends hours practicing, be it his swing, footwork, glove work, he is always striving to improve his game. 
                His commitment paid off when he and his team went undefeated last season, which is a testament to their hard work. Nicholas looks up to his older brother Jayden. 
                Jayden is 15 years old and has also played since he could walk. Jayden and Nicholas run track together and are always pushing each other to be better versions of themselves. 
                Nicholas hopes to follow in his brother's footsteps in becoming a nationally ranked high school player. 
                Off the field, Nicholas enjoys studying the game, watching his favorite team, the New York Yankees, and rooting for his favorite player Aaron Judge. 
                But it’s not all about sports; Nicholas values his schoolwork and excels in his studies, particularly enjoying science. 
                As Nicholas continues to grow, both in height and skill, he aspires to play baseball at a collegiate level and dreams of one day taking the field for the Yankees. 
                But for now, he’s focused on the next game, the next at bat, and the next chance to make us all proud.
